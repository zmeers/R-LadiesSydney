## Uh... What are parliament plots? `r emo::ji("confused")`

- They are visual representations of the composition of legislatures.


- Parliament plots often display seats color-coded by party


- This is one the first attempts at creating an `R` package for parliament plots

## ggparliament

- ggparliament was first started by Thomas Leeper


- Rob Hickman and I have taken over the package


- The idea is that it creates `ggplot2` objects of parliamentary seats that integrate seamlessly with other `tidyverse` packages


- Currently working on the development version of the package
  - ggparliament is not on CRAN

  - We can plot several parliament styles ranging from the horseshoe parliament (like the one we have here!) or two opposing benches (like the in UK)

## Great...`r emo::ji("smile")` How can we use it?

- Start with aggregate election results. 


- We include data from several countries several in the package. 


- For example, I will look at the Australian 2016 election.


- The data frame looks like this ...


## 
```{r}
library(ggparliament)
australia <- election_data %>% # the data we have included is in election_data
  filter(year == 2016 &  # filter for country, year, and legislative chamber
           country == "Australia" &
           house == "Representatives")
head(australia)
```


## Data munging
- We want to expand the aggregated seats per party into a long list of individual seats and plot the location of each seat on the chart


- We created a function, `parliament_data()`, that will do this for you!


##

```{r}
#I am reordering the data to reflect the way the Australian parliament is structured
#(gov't on right, opposition on left) but this isn't strictly neccesary
australia <- australia[c(1, 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2), ]
#run your election results through parliament_data()
aus <- parliament_data(election_data = australia, # you need to specify the data frame
                       total_seats = sum(australia$seats), # sum up the total amount of seats
                       party_seats = australia$seats, # number of seats per party
                       parl_rows = 4, # how many rows do we want?
                       type = "horseshoe") # what type of parliament do we want?
head(aus)
```


## Now... The fun stuff `r emo::ji("smile")`
```{r}
ggplot(aus, aes(x, y, colour=party_long)) + #define the data frame and how you want to colour the circles
  geom_parliament_seats() + # this geom plots the seats
  theme_void() + # we have created a theme for the package but this is optional
  labs(colour = "", title = "Australia House of Representatives") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = aus$colour, limits = aus$party_long)
```
## Cool. What else?
- We can highlight certain seats!


- This is a work in progress


- We can add text to the plot as well


- We're working on ways to break up the seats by faceting. 

## 

```{r}
ggplot(aus, aes(x, y, colour=party_long)) +
  geom_parliament_seats() +
  theme_void() +
  geom_highlight_government(government == 1) +
  labs(colour = "", title = "Australia House of Representatives",
  subtitle = "Government encircled in black.") +
  annotate("text", x=0, y=2, label=paste("Total: 150 MPs"), fontface="bold", size=12) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = aus$colour, limits = aus$party_long)
```
